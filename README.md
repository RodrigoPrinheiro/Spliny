# Spliny 

## A simple 3D spline solution for Unity 

#### by [Rodrigo Pinheiro][github]

### How to use
* Add a `PathCreator.cs` behaviour script to the object that will manage the spline

![splineMonobehaviour][behaviour]
* You can now shape, save and load paths to your liking

* You can create new behaviours using the created paths like the one in the `Examples` folder `MoveAlongPath.cs`.

![movePathBehaviour][moveBehaviour]

* Enjoy!

### About Updates

I don't plan on updating this asset regurarly, if I have the need for extra behaviour,
feel like adding some personalization options or I find a major bug while using it I can
update it. Other than that I still want to add at least a custom window to change the
curve visualization parameters like colors and gizmo sizes.

### Using it in Projects

Feel free to use this asset, the code is simple and someone might learn something from
peaking. If you do release something using this asset I appreciate referring me in the
credits. Thanks!
